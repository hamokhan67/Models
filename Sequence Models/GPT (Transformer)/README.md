  <title>Transformer Decoder Model</title>

  <p>
    This project implements a transformer-based decoder-only model. Unlike the full Transformer model, which includes both encoder and decoder components, this implementation focuses solely on the decoder. It can be used for tasks where context from previous tokens is sufficient to generate the next token.
